# Project Title

This is a marketing page for the React App called "Simpsons Says!", a quote generator that covers most of the seasons of 
the Simpsons.
It offers user signup functionality, quote searching by string, and quote generating by character. 

## Getting Started

Fork your own version of this repository, then launch index.html or about.html. Be sure to also run Less Watch Compiler
if you need to 

### Prerequisites

A reliable code editor, such as VS code.
A CSS compiler, I used Less, along with the less-watch-compiler, which adds a live report of what you're updating.

### Editing

I used HTML, CSS, and JS to build this website. Knowledge of this is required to change this website.
Use whatever code you wish, and push to your own branch on your forked repository.

## Deployment

Choose a good hosting system and copy all of the files into their requisite areas. I used netlify.

## Built With

VS Code.
